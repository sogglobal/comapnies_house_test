Companies House – Lead Test Engineer Technical Assessment
Candidate: Soala  Gbenedio
Date:31 Oct 2025  
Project:Cypress Automation – Booking Flow (https://automationintesting.online)  
Objective:Validate core booking functionality (“Booking Today” and “Booking Confirmation” flows) for end-to-end booking creation and verification.

Scope
This test plan focuses on verifying that:
- Users can make a booking successfully via the front-end form.
- The booking data is correctly submitted, stored, and visible in the confirmation section.
- Form validation, field-level error handling, and data persistence function as expected.

Key Functional Areas:
1. Home Page load and availability.
2. Booking form input fields (Name, Email, Phone, Dates, Message).
3. Date picker validation (today + future dates).
4. Booking submission and confirmation message.
5. Booking visibility in admin (if available).
6. Negative validations (missing fields, invalid email, invalid dates).
7. API call validation (request/response structure and HTTP status).

 Test Data
 Field  Positive Example  Negative Example 
--------------------------------------------
 Name  "John Doe"  "" (empty) 
 Email  "john.doe@email.com"  "john.doe@com" 
 Phone  "07123456789"  "123" 
 Dates  Today + Tomorrow  Past date

  Test Execution Strategy
- Automated using Cypress.
- Run both in headless (CI) and interactive (local) mode.
- Assertions cover DOM validation, form submission, and API response verification.
- Non-functional checks (basic performance and network response times).
